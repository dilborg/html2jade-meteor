# HTML2Jade: Meteor Edition

Converts your Meteor [Spacebar-enabled](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spacebars/README.md) HTML to [Jade](https://github.com/mquandalle/meteor-jade) with ease.
Unlike any other tools available out there, it works with default Meteor examples out-of-the-box.

## Prerequisites

Install the following dependencies:

- [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt)

## Usage

`grunt run`

Online version is available on [html2jade.vstark.net](http://html2jade.vstark.net)

## Kudos

This project would not be possible without a great tool called [html2jade](https://github.com/donpark/html2jade).
